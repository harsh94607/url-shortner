# url-shortner
As an intern at Code Clause, my second task involves developing a URL Shortener web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient tool that allows users to convert long URLs into short, shareable links.

The web application's frontend will be designed using HTML and CSS, with a focus on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The layout will include an input field where users can enter their lengthy URLs and a "Shorten" button to trigger the conversion process.
